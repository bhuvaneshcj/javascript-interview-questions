### 1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It is part of the three core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While HTML and CSS are responsible for structure and styling, JavaScript handles the behavior of a website. JavaScript can also be used in server-side development (with Node.js), mobile applications, and more.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="heading">Hello, World!</h1>
    <button onclick="changeText()">Click me!</button>

    <script>
        function changeText() {
            document.getElementById('heading').innerText = 'You clicked the button!';
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
Here, clicking the button changes the text of the `<h1>` element using JavaScript.

### 2. What are the data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript has several data types, including:

- **Primitive types:** These types are immutable.
    - ***String:*** Represents textual data.
    - ***Number:*** Represents numbers (both integers and floating-point).
    - ***Boolean:*** Represents true or false values.
    - ***Null:*** Represents an intentional absence of any object value.
    - ***Undefined:*** Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
    - ***Symbol:*** Introduced in ES6, used to create unique identifiers.
    - ***BigInt:*** Introduced in ES2020, used for very large integers.

- **Non-primitive types:** Objects, Arrays, Functions.

```
let str = "Hello";  // String
let num = 42;       // Number
let bool = true;    // Boolean
let undef;          // Undefined
let empty = null;   // Null
let symbol = Symbol('unique'); // Symbol
let bigInt = 9007199254740991n; // BigInt
```
