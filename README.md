### 1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It is part of the three core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While HTML and CSS are responsible for structure and styling, JavaScript handles the behavior of a website. JavaScript can also be used in server-side development (with Node.js), mobile applications, and more.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="heading">Hello, World!</h1>
    <button onclick="changeText()">Click me!</button>

    <script>
        function changeText() {
            document.getElementById('heading').innerText = 'You clicked the button!';
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
Here, clicking the button changes the text of the `<h1>` element using JavaScript.
